# Google image search example using Firefox browser

Executes Google image search and stores the first result image using the Firerfox
browser downloaded from Conda Forge. (the right webdriver is automatically handled by
the library itself)

Execution is done in fully headless mode so the browser will not even be visible, this
way the robot is runnable in Robocorp's Control Room (Cloud Container) as it is.
